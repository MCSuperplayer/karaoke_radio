# MC's Karaoke Radio Player
##### My own take on a radio player inspired by Swarm FM
(Please check them out if you're interested, they've made some impressive stuff over time)

This player is entirely built with Python, sqlite3, Google Drive integration and uses VLC to play the audio tracks.

Obviously, it's still work in progress, the control panel does nothing yet for example.

In the future, the control panel will have these options:
- Manual queuing of tracks that play before automatic play continues
- moving the player's display window
- playback controls (play,pause,skip)
- song scoring (songs with a higher score will play again sooner than those with lower score)
